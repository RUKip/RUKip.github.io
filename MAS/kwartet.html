                                    Kwartet is a card game that requires the players to use logic to win. In this game
                                    the goal is to collect sets of cards of the same group, also called a kwartet, by
                                    asking other players for cards.
                                    The game requires knowledge of your own cards, the card set and the previous asked
                                    cards to figure out which player has the cards you require for completing a Kwartet.
                                </p>
                                <p class="article-text">
									In this project we try to make a working simulation of kwartet using logic rules for a multi agent system. The system is played by computer generated agents which make decision based on their model. 
									This article will explain our decisions, steps, results and some theory behind the game. 
                                    The simulation is programmed in Python 3 and uses only the Python standard library.
                                    The code can be found <a href="https://github.com/RUKip/kwartet" target="_blank">here</a>.
                                    The simulation is tracked by logging steps from the simulation to a log file.
                                    Furthermore we added graph generation of the indivdual agent models, the models can
                                    be found in the "knowledge-graphs" directory, created upon running the program.

								<p class="article-text">
                                    Besides our goal of making a working kwartet simulation using logic rules we also have set ourselves the extra goal of finding out the best kwartet strategy and become kwartet masters!
                                    We also thought it would be a nice addition if you could join the agents in a game of kwaret. So there are 2 modes in this kwartet, one were you can let agents play against each other and one where you can play against other agents using the terminal.
                                </p>

                                    The game of Kwartet is played in random order.
                                    That is, after a player finishes his turn, the player last asked a card starts
                                    his turn. On your turn, you can ask for a card to any other player.
                                    If the other player does not have the card, your turn is over and his will start.
                                    If the other player does have the card, he has to give the card to you and you
                                    may ask another question to any of the players. Your turn ends at the moment you
                                    get no as an answer. The game has two more rules. Firstly, you can only ask for
                                    a card if you have a card of the same group. So, you are only allowed to ask for
                                    ‘a fat cow’ if you own at least one of the other ‘farm animals’ cards. Secondly,
                                    which may be the most important rule of Kwartet, you are not allowed to lie.
                                    If someone asks you for a card that you own, you have to give him the card.

                                    Every group consists of 4 cards. If you have collected all cards from a group,
                                    you earn 1 point and the group is out of the game. The game ends if all groups
                                    are collected and there are no cards left in the game. The player with the most
                                    points, i.e. the player that collected the most groups is the winner.

                                            Suppose Diego, Ruben and Tanja are playing a game of Kwartet.
                                            Like John Snow, Diego knows nothing, starting the game by asking a random
                                            card to a random player.
                                            In this case he asked Tanja for the 'smelly goat' card from the 'farm
                                            animals' group.
                                            Even before Tanja gives an answer, the knowledge of the players changes.
                                            To see what happens with the knowledge we go through the first questions of
                                            this game step by step.

                                        single
                                        card is known. Furthermore a card group is of higher order than a card,
                                        optimizing
                                        the search for possible options. If a card is known, the group is known, so
                                        there
                                        is no option of a known card in a <b>M</b> or <b>deleted</b> group.

                                        While playing different strategies we require to look at different observables,
                                        as an example we need to look not only at cards but also at card groups
                                        (<a href="#figure-model-group">Figure 2</a>).In our model we require a seperate
                                        model for each of these observables, this is because of a limitation in our
                                        datastructure. We cannot "remove" a world in the model without affecting worlds
                                        that should still be accesble from other worlds. As an example we cannot remove
                                        a group for one agent without removing the group for all agents.

                                        There are 5 actions that influence the knowledge structure (model):

                                            By the basic step of looking at which cards an agent has in his hand, we can
                                            update the model by removing worlds where these cards are owned by other
                                            players. This step is private for each individual agent.
                                        </li>

                                            the rules, requesting a card can only be done when you have a card from the
                                            group. This is a public announcement, so for each agent we update the model,
                                            replacing <b>M</b>(requested_group) because we have <b>K</b>(requested_group)

                                            one of the most important announcements. After this action we update the
                                            model for each agent. Every agent knows that the player that was asked for
                                            the card does not have it any more. Every agent also knows that the player
                                            that asked for the card, has it now. Furthermore, they know that the agent
                                            that was asked for the card might not have cards of the mentioned group any
                                            longer. So, unless a player knows with certainty that the player who was
                                            requested a card has other cards of that group, he will set the group state

											We tested implemented strategies by running the game 100 times using 4 agents and 24 cards. We choose 4 agents so exclusion does not play a direct role.  
											Keep in mind that in kwartet there always plays a certain 'luck' factor, created by the random division of cards and questioning. We tried to decrease the effect by the increasing in player count, card number and of course number of games.  
											The resulting win percentages using the different strategies are below: 
											<table>
												<tr>
													<th><i>Strategy</i></th>
													<th><i>Agent 1</i></th>
													<th><i>Agent 2</i></th>
													<th><i>Agent 3</i></th>
													<th><i>Agent 4</i></th>

													<th>25%</th>
													<th>26%</th>
													<th>10%</th>

											We also tested perfomance, as the model grows exponentionally it is intresting to know what the limits in cards, strategy and agent count is.

											Looking at the results between the different strategies, we can already see the 'luck' factor playing a role in that the win percentages are not equal over the agents. 
											This effect is further strenghtened by the fact that the python Random library as with all random functions is a Pseudo-Random
                                            function, this means the randomization is deterministic. We will however act like the randomization in card division and unknown card choice as fully
                                            random. This because a better strategy is still visible when agents play different strategies.
                                            <br>
                                            Not suprisingly we can clearly see that the first order logic already almost always beats the random agents. The random agents in principle only use <b>Deleted</b> and <b>M</b>, by adding <b>K</b> agent 1 can ask all cards when they are known without them being asked back as quickly. 
                                            <br>
											When implementing different strategies, it is depended on what strategies
                                            the other agents play to have a bigger chance at winning. Finding the best
                                            and most resilient strategy was not our goal, but might be very good

                                            We have chosen a model per agent instead of one full model containing
                                            all worlds and agent relations. In our opinion a per agent model makes more
                                            sense, as in real life situations agents are isolated, therefore an agent
                                            cannot easily rely on a model that is shared with multiple agents. A model
                                            per agent gives the extra flexibility of fully isolated decision making.

                                                The simulation works as expected, however there is still a lot of
                                                improvements possible as we will mention in the <a href="#improvements">improvements</a>
                                                section. Our simulation does not manage to solve higher logic then
                                                second order, but for the game of Kwartet this is not a very important
                                                skill. The second order logic can be useful in cases like, when an agent
                                                uses the fact that another agent knows his card, trying to get a Kwartet
                                                for this card as soon as possible. Performance wise the model is able to handle an acceptable growing amount of players and cards.

                                                From the strategies we implemented, we concluded that ... is the best
                                                strategy, although as mentioned earlier in the discussion this is very
                                                dependent.
                                                Adding second order logic, is usefull for agents to win games as can be
                                                seen in the results. ..
